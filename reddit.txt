I complain a lot about northeastern, but don’t be fooled, it’s amazing. Reasons: 1) In my program at least- the faculty and support (via academic advising especially, but also coop advisor and UHCS prescribing -not the care, just the prescribing) are amazing!!! When I go home and talk to friends about their colleges and experiences in their programs it’s clear that northeastern professors (and the administration in general) care a lot about creating an environment where you have personal, individualized access to your professors and their help/advice/research/whatever you need. Some schools’ professors and administrations just care about their research or getting you -a number, to them- through the program by failing people out who won’t “make it” and pushing those through who do. Northeastern clearly cares about teaching as a first priority- it’s why tuition makes up such a large portion of the budget and it’s what they get paid to do. 2) (and this is why I came here) A lot of universities these days emphasize “growing the whole student” and “the college experience” so they have a lot of gen eds, and don’t place nearly as much of a value on teaching students to navigate/interact with industry, or prepare them to have a successful career outside of academia afterward. Not that northeastern doesn’t place emphasis on those things- their study abroad is almost unparalleled, there are still robust opportunities to pursue academia (instead of industry, if that’s what you want to do), and there are still liberal arts programs and -to some degree- requirements (via NUpath) that encourage balance. BUT, above all you pretty much know that if you come here, Northeastern is going to teach you how to be great at something and how to be a professional in that field when you leave. No studying something then not being able to find a money-making job in the field after graduation and having to give up on it. You want to be an animator or fine arts major (traditionally hard fields to break into) the entire culture of the university is set up to help you -not just learn animation- but find a job in it. Northeastern makes a young professional out of you quickly. There are some downsides to that -it’s not a particularly warm place to be, everyone is constantly leaving classes/friends to go on coop or study abroad, so sometimes it’s hard to keep in touch, and the university pretty unfairly supports applied sciences/business programs above all others- but it creates a culture of staying in-touch with post-college reality, and getting you where you want to go. 3) Some colleges/universities try to shy away from any practice of cultural traditions/religion on their campuses (as practice of one religion might alienate students from another etc.) Northeastern takes (I think) a much better approach of actively encouraging/celebrating everyone’s traditions and religions: there is a nativity set on top of curry at Christmas time, but there are also menorah lighting gatherings in krentzman, and the northeastern Diwali celebration is lit every year 4) Being so big and having so many campuses all over the place, Northeastern naturally has an enormous pool of opportunities for research, clubs, study abroad, pretty much anything. They have achieved economies of scale in being a college and we all benefit from that. Not super unique to Northeastern, but still 5) For all the flak we give the administration, Northeastern is incredibly innovative. They are constantly coming up with new programs and ways to make things more efficient/better for students. Sometimes they use that innovative spirit in ways that are only good for the administration, but most of the time it benefits everyone. There is no complacency. If you want to do something, the answer seems to usually be “how can we make that happen” instead of “are you sure, no one else has tried that before” see: Combined majors, undergrad research/project grants (supposedly very under-utilized btw), and -hot take, but: all of NUin. You can see my point here in rankings too. Northeastern is very high on “most innovative” rankings So, I complain relentlessly about weird stuff the administration does, lack of mental health resources (what happened Tuesday of finals week in the library was fucked up), Covid response etc. but northeastern is still an amazing school and the right one for me and way under-rated IMO. It just needs some tweaks every once in a while, and I think that’s what we hear most about

is it really harder to say? we have data on the lethality of covid by age group before vaccines. not trying to be an asshole here, just challenging your thinking. in october of last year, 1-2 months after campuses across the country re-opened, 3 students had been hospitalized nationwide. for comparison, 24,000 college students attempt suicide every year, and these objectively unnecessary restrictions drove that number far higher. statistically, people aged 18-25 are more likely to die if they get the flu than covid (unvaccinated). just reciting statistics. covid was never a threat to college students. pretending it is, however, is a threat to the mental and physical health of college students.

Omicron is a lot weaker than the delta and the original. I had omicron last week and I got covid earlier around august. Omicron was like a 2 day fever while Covid was like a 5 day situation (at least thats how it was for me). According to most reports I've read, omicron is very mild compared to covid-19 in terms of symptoms and hospitalization rate. I also will be receiving the booster in a week, but in regards to your question I don't think it matters when people get the booster as long as they get it before campus.

Is this the same as NUin? If so, you’ll be off campus for your first semester and come back during the spring semester. I met some kids who went through NUin and loved it! It’s always cool to start off your college experience abroad. Some people are weary because of COVID, but that decision is up to you. Usually kids who are accepted NUin have to go abroad and I don’t think there’s any way for you to be on the Boston campus (last year because of COVID they had NUin Boston but I’m not sure if that’s a location again). I’ve heard it can be hard for kids to adjust to spring semester, especially since half of your classmates would have been on campus the first half. If that doesn’t bother you, then go ahead! I’ve loved my experience at NU so far, so I would have done anything to be at the school even if it required me to go abroad. Hope this helps (and is the same program lmao)

This is probably chock full of much better graphics to illustrate concerns in regards to national covid spread: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/28/us/covid-deaths.html The fact is that if you’re vaccinated and boosted, covid really is just like a flu - I was talking to an at-home nurse (not one of the conspiracy theory types lol) literally today about one of their patients with COPD - fucking COPD! - who got through a bout of covid just fine. If you’re unvaccinated, you’re plainly and simply fucked, and a liability to yourself and others. Thankfully, MA is close to 75% fully vaccinated and I think about 90% partially vaccinated. Our hospitalization rate is lower and deaths are very low - on top of that, I believe 2/3 of those hospitalized and effectively all of the deaths are unvaccinated people. Moral of the story? Get vaccinated, or you might as well walk across Huntington with a blindfold a couple times.

tell them that rising COVID cases are scaring you and your family. You need to live alone off campus, away from the overadmitted dorms. If you have an underlying medical issue state it. If you have financial issues state it. Get parents on board and you will be off campus. Housing and most universities is a giant scam and used to increase their revenue and control students. Northeastern loves their housing requirement because it allows for more control, which their strangely authoritarian system feeds on. If housing was truly for students it wouldn’t be more expensive than surrounding areas for a room that two people share. The quality of most dorms is low, infested with rats and other pests. Nobody should be living in dorms unless they pay significantly less, in which case why complain when you are given a gift like cheap housing.

I just saw OP’s comment that this is percent of population that catches covid - that’s a pretty simple explanation in that case. If 10k people in California catch covid, and 10k people in Connecticut catch covid, CT is going to have a way higher proportion of the population with covid than CA. Honestly this graphic doesn’t really show much in terms of spread; state boundaries are arbitrary in relation to dense zones of population. Unless you already know populations of states (and individual mask mandates/vax rates), this graphic won’t tell you much except that you’re more or less likely to encounter someone with covid while in that state.

People that take home tests don’t report to health agencies + significantly more lab testing available to residents of the northeast regions due to significantly higher rates of health insurance and healthcare availability + heavy spread thanks to Omicron = much higher reported cases in these states despite similar or lower positive rates and wastewater RNA levels compared to others. The “cold” reason is a little silly, we’ve had some surprisingly warm periods and northern areas of the midwest have similar weather patterns. They likely are seeing similar spread, but we also simply don’t know for sure, the piecemeal testing strategies and mask/vaccine implementation has only been exacerbated by such a long time with COVID as a threat. Basically, everywhere is struggling - just be careful not to spread it to others and take only risks you feel prepared to take the consequences for.

No I totally get that and most people I know who got COVID had very mild symptoms too, however making a blanket statement that the isolation period is 5 days is dangerous. We just don’t want people who aren’t using a campus bedspace or living elsewhere to see that and assume they only have to isolate for 5 days if they’re sick. I know someone who was still testing positive on antigen tests (which can tell you if you’re still contagious) on day 8. If they had seen the 5-day rule and thought it applied to them to, who knows how many people they would have infected

you're on the right track, but consider these points: First, why do you say "it's all about the hospitalizations now?" Not that you're wrong, but wasn't this always the case? There are two bad outcomes from covid: hospitalization and death. We know college students never had any risk of being hospitalized (statistically less likely than the flu, even before vaccines). Why didn't we take this approach last year? I seem to think it was all political/PR-related virtue signaling - we made kids miserable and compromised their educations. Why are you still concerned about masks? Large-scale, real-life data from cities, states and nationwide shows that masks do not stop the spread...and even if they do a little bit, who cares? What's the end game here? The omicron variant is less deadly to old, fat or immunocompromised people, and we have somewhat effective vaccines and highly effective early treatments (Massachusetts is just very behind on implementing them due to overemphasis on vaccines). My point - people are going to get infected, masks or not, and if they take basic steps to protect themselves, they will be fine. There should be some personal responsibility here - stop blaming people who aren't wearing masks or who haven't taken a vaccine (which the most reliable studies show to have minimal effect on transmission) for a rapidly mutating virus that exists everywhere on the planet.

honestly i’m sick of covid restrictions and covid theater but i’m starting to agree with this. At this point, if you’re not isolating you’re going to get covid. Restrictions are insignificant unless you really lockdown and basically close essential stores. And hospitalizations are low except for the unvaccinated (and even then they’re not rising). We should stop trying to limit the spread and accept that covid is inevitable, because covid is inevitable regardless (and seems to be mild for most people by now). But this also means we have to accept that it’s not safe for really at-risk people to go out. And it’s already unfair for them to be barred from society, we mine as well limit how much they’re restricted and allow as much stuff to be remote as possible. Maybe only for really at-risk people, but NU should accommodate some form of remote teaching and learning.

Yes, but Delta was already more contagious than the flu, and Omicron is much more contagious than Delta. Yes, both these folks and their families would always be cautious. For example, my liver transplant friend has a laundry list of things he's not allowed to do anymore, like swimming in a lake and eating certain foods. People with newborns usually limit the number of people who are allowed near their kids until they are able to get their first few rounds of vaccines and in my nephew's case, his parents are trying to limit his potential to catch diseases even more until he's old enough to have reconstructive surgery that should help him withstand respiratory infections. I'm just saying that these people should be allowed the option to continue looking out for their families by staying home when they need to, not that everyone needs to stay home all the time. For example, a professor with a kid like my nephew should be able to record lectures that people can watch for homework and then arrange with a TA to have study sessions in person in the place of a traditional classroom. That kind of "flipped classroom" was already getting some buzz before the pandemic as maybe a better way to learn anyway. My mother (a professor) was able to do something like this pre-COVID when two of her immediate family members died of separate illnesses in different states within a month or so of each other. Why can't we extend that kind of compassion now?

Does this mean there’s gonna be no online option at all??? What he fuck. What about people who test positive for covid? What about people who, like me, have other activities in their lives for which they need a negative test?? I fully agree with the idea that we need to not worry about covid cases so much anymore in a fully vaccinated, boostered, young population, and that letting covid case numbers guide decision making is no longer the way to go, but the reality is that other institutions in our world are still testing and still treating positive cases like lepers, not to mention the people who are immunocompromised or have immunocompromised family who still have a good reason to avoid any kind of infection. People should still have the choice to go online if they want to, understanding that their own education will suffer as a result. But that should be their choice. This announcement seems so self-centered, like “we know the inconvenience that the huge spike of positive cases we are voluntarily causing will be a big inconvenience to some people, but it’s all ok because everyone gets to be in classes, which is the most important part of your lives!!

I’m not concerned about serious injury or death from COVID because I’m fully vaccinated. None of those things listed are on par with the amount of students that tested positive for COVID in the last semester and with the rise in cases and a more transmissible variant the numbers will only be higher in the coming semester. The main issue is that anyone who tests positive has to self isolate and cannot even attend these in person classes. Forcing everyone back on campus while cases are at an all time high is just a recipe for a lot of positive tests and people who can’t even come to class. When someone is isolating they will have to have some way of attending class remotely anyways or else miss out on instruction completely.

So what happens if you get an illness or experience a personal tragedy mid semester? Pre Covid students toutinely contracted the flu, colds, meningitis, pneumonia, and other injuries like broken bones or food poisoning or had other events like family deaths impacting their careers as students. You can’t bubble wrap the entire school. You’ll always break a few eggs on the way. The best risk mitigation strategy isn’t seeking 100% safety, it’s mitigating the worst known outcomes and they’ve done that with testing and vaccine requirements. It’s not sustainable and it very much appears that with variants like omicron, healthy students who have robust immune systems and the mandated vaccinations are not at risk for severe outcomes. If you are still worried you can wear a mask, exercise, eat healthy, get plenty of vitamin D, zinc, magnesium etc and social distance. But yo expect everyone to comply ad infinitum you’re just going to splinter and fracture an already tenuous peace and see students unenroll to go to schools with better Covid response planning. I’d you want a better outcome to transfer to BC. Go huskies.

For all the people mentioning that they wanted to have an online option, I understand your frustrations. But I do think this is the right way forward. The quality of our education has, imo, gone down considerably during the year we were hybrid. Part of that is professors having to re-make their lesson plans to exclude or remake in person activities. Part of that was the reason people choose to come to a university like ours, to make connections with people they meet in class to grow into friendships and possibly professional networking connections which is fairly hard to do over zoom. We are all not only vaccinated but also boosted. Omicron is looking to be a significantly milder illness than anything that came before it. The administration is right, covid is endemic. We're going to have spikes like this every year for the foreseeable future. This should not concern is too much, we are all protected.

If its endemic then positivity rates shouldn't matter, thats the whole point of the concerns over covid amongst the student body seem to be more related to the restrictions than the actual disease.

> It is now clear that COVID-19, in various forms, will be with us for the foreseeable future. As we move into this endemic phase of the pandemic, our job is to continue to control Covid effectively, not let Covid control us. A key part of this will be less emphasis on positive case counts and laser focus on preventing severe illness and hospitalizations. In a community that is fully vaccinated, and boosted, our strategy should not be driven by positive cases. For perspective, last year Northeastern had more than 1,800 positive tests on its Boston campus, with a single known hospitalization.

You’ve wildly missed the point here. As a group of mostly young, vaccinated and boosted individuals, covid is no different than the flu that we have been living with for decades. Getting sick and missing some class is not a novel part of life, and it’s ass backwards for you to act like it is a new development of covid that we need to be catering to

Said it in the other threads and I’ll say it here: What the fuck was the point of investing all that money into NUflex if they aren’t even gonna give students a choice. Saying that COVID is now endemic as we’re seeing some of the highest positivity rates of the whole pandemic comes across as so tone deaf. What happens if someone does get it? They are still gonna have to quarantine and miss out on the in-person learning anyway. Will there be a remote option for them in that case? By all means let people who want to be in-person attend but to force everyone back onto campus in the midst of the most contagious strain yet seems completely asinine, especially as the long term effects of having COVID are still not well understood.

After starting over for the academic year, the data was completely removed from the site. It’s one thing to update visualizations to only show recent semesters, it’s another thing to fully remove all access to older data. Furthermore, until recently, they only displayed the variant breakdown per day, deleting the previous days data. The covid case breakdown between faculty, students, and staff is still deleted every day. If Northeastern wanted to share their data in good faith, they would not do that.

Is this about forcing people to vaccinate or actually about spread/protection? Because there are serious logical fallacies here. The "protected from the unvaccinated" talking point. Are vaccinated people not already protected, by being vaccinated? Does the vaccine not work? Can't vaccinated people enter a restaurant full of covid-positive vaccinated people anyways? The "reduce the spread" talking point. Do vaccinated people not contract and spread covid anymore? Do you, personally, not know many vaccinated people who have gotten and spread covid? Also, unvaccinated people are disproportionately likely to have already contracted covid and thus have natural immunity - which is significantly more protective than vaccination alone, as it teaches the immune system to respond to all 27 proteins in the coronavirus, rather than just the one spike protein in a vaccine. A recent study from israel concluded that this protection was 27x greater.

They should let you schedule your two tests at the Marino symptomatic COVID testing center. There should've been a link on the daily wellness check you submitted that let's you book a test there.

See I googled and found that, and there's no data on boosted people there specifically, as "fully vaccinated" = two doses there (or 1 of J&J). Are we arguing the same side here? I read your comment to be that you were implying that boosters weren't effective, which seems to contradict with data here: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status

There is literally CDC data that shows boosters reduce cases: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status There's a line between healthy skepticism and cutting off your nose off to spite your face. Boosters are a way to reduce alarm. Pharmaceutical corruption and biased interests are real, but don't nullify the real effects of boosters. Right now the most alarmism I'm seeing is from this specific wave of anti-booster crowd right now ironically.

Literally click the link in that tweet and see there's a clear line of differences in cases in the past two months, rather than a screenshot that ends in October. https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status COVID cases are 2x or more for unboosted. Much better than unvaccinated but a clear advantage to a booster. Even if deaths were the same, you limit spread which will in turn limit deaths of others. Deaths are also trending clearly lower (currently 2-3x) in the last few weeks of October, which is in line with the first booster recommendation, which is still a ways off from any larger data sets as 18+ got boosted. This data is severely lagging, but even the data posted is trending to make your statement false.

bro it is the same line of logic. People go to college and they are taking a risk with Covid. People drive on roads and take a risk of getting hurt, which I would argue is even bigger. There are so many things that we could "shut down" to save lives, but it's completely impractical.

Omicron variant has a low hospitalization rate so far, furthermore the general population of Boston has an extremely low hospitalization rate for COVID. So what’s the rush/urgency in creating all these mandates and requirements. Allowing the population to recover both physically and mentally is not in the goal of the government. Never has been, as stupid as the Anti-vax movement is, their distrust of government is warranted. Their distrust of modern medicine is the issue most people should be worried about.

How am I a sheep for recognizing that viruses mutate, especially at a time like this when it’s still spreading and many are unvaccinated, and therefore new vaccines will have to be taken in order to protect ourselves from new strands? We’ve presumably all been doing this our whole lives with the flu if we go to Northeastern. So if it turns out Covid goes down a similar route, sure, it’d be an inconvenience, but not something that would make me unhappy or make me fill like I missed out on my life.

The CDC, FDA, NIH, etc a collected 70 billion + a year still have not conducted a study of covid natural immunity. Hmm maybe that’s because if they studied it it would show that it should be an exemption for vaccination. Ah well I believe The Science, i mean Fauci, who is self declared to be the science, its all very confusing.

I’m not sure if the new policy makes any sense. NYC has tried and and we are seeing their cases spike anyways so it clearly isn’t an effective solution and you can’t say “oh it prob would’ve been worse without it” bc you can say whatever you want about hypotheticals all day. In addition, if vaccinated people are still getting and spreading the virus, why would only they be allowed in certain places? They could have vaccine, show passport, get in, and also be positive for COVID and spread it to people inside even though they were vaccinated so to me it makes no sense. If you are vaccinated, you shouldn’t care about being around unvaccinated individuals if you really thought the vaccine worked. The recent spike is not due to unvaccinated individuals and it’s only proving that vaccinated individuals are still capable (and are the majority) of spreading it. So why care if unvaccinated people are there, the difference in vaccinated vs unvaccinated seems trivial at this point. When will they come up with an actual solution or let everyone go back to normal?

Highest vaccination rate in the country only to have out of touch politicians with medical sector lobbyists pushing hard mandates on a population that is not threatened by COVID. If we have a mask mandate + vaccine we don’t need a booster. I just can’t help but feel they are really pushing for uneccessary precaution. I wouldn’t go as far to say this is a mode of control for the government but there is clearly some financial motive.

You have to accept that masks are here to stay. They prevent spread at some level, and despite much fuss they don't really have negative side effects in most cases, particularly not these ones. COVID isn't going away in the near term unless we take drastic global quarantine efforts to snuff it out and prevent new variants, which is clear we are not going to be able to do, so we're going to probably have masks around for the next 5-10 years at least until COVID manages to mutate itself to something harmless or we find a near 100% effective vaccine.

I'm (thankfully) not a CS major but I would guess it depends a lot on how you manage your time/how well you are able to complete the work. The burnout posts are real and absolutely a big issue but I think a lot of it comes from covid and the general shittiness that is going to college during these times. As a student doing a combined major in D'amore McKim and CSSH I usually have a lot of work but I mostly like it and it is totally manageable. It would be a lot easier if I actually knew how to study tho lol. I wouldn't psyc urself out too much. Even if you don't have a strong cs background I'm sure there are absolutely ppl like you who have managed to succeed and excel. It's all about your mindset even though there are sometimes really big obstacles that get in the way. Hopefully some CS majors can give you more insight into that program specifically but I would imagine that workload for your major is gonna be a lot at any competitive cs school. Good luck with your application process!

Nobody promised that if you got two shots the world would be magically fixed. We were told that getting vaxxed would stop the spread and guess what, it did and it does. Yes, it's not perfect, it was never expected to be. Without the vaccine we would be in a way worse place. I'm not happy that it's not going as well as the media hoped but the science still says that vax mandates and mask requirements will help slow this down. Welcome to new normal. It's gonna take a long ass time for things to be closer to how they were but we just need to suck it up. Let's be thankful we are in new england where we are way less likely to contract covid. Complain if we have another lockdown, don't complain that the gov't is trying to protect ppl. I get where ur coming from that if we have vax requirements masks are not as necessary but omicron still gets ppl that are vaxxed. Wu is just like every other person in the country. We all don't like masks and we all don't like vaccine mandates. If the science says this is the best way to help us, let's not be ignorant and listen to the ppl who know what they're talking about. PS. vax mandates and mask requirements aren't gonna magically fix this either. it's gonna take time but let's not be stupid and ignore them which will just slow this whole thing down even more

Not entirely sure where this is directed. I was trying to make a point that a vaccine mandate is a good thing because unvaxxed ppl are more likely to spread covid and we should do whatever we reasonably can to stop the spread.

COVID vaccines are not meant as preventing infection but meant to reduce severe disease which they significantly have done
